# This file lists what we think the most widely used
# security scanners identifyable via their user agents.
#
# The list is curated by hand. Attempts to machine-generate
# a larger list leads to a lot of false positives and edge
# cases where certain scanners / bots are welcome in certain
# situations. We consider this a baseline of unwanted scanners.
